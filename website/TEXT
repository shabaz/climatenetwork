Basic Network Metrics
---------------------

The network is generated by using the multivariate correlated time-series. The
data is pruned to throw away 99% of the links. We show the data based on the
metrics in a greyscale. Black is a low value, white is a high value. The metrics
interestingly show the contours of the land.

Network Construction
--------------------
The network is generated by using the multivariate correlated time-series. The
data is pruned to throw away 99% of the links. After this the data is used for
the basic network metrics. We see some patterns and the non-locality is clear by
the many long distance links that exist.

Data sets
---------
These datasets are taken from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis project. The data shown is the raw data.


Granger Causality
-----------------

The network is generated using the granger causality of neighbouring cells less
than 5 cells away. We use a delay of 1 timeslot. The data we used was the daily
data from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis project. After this we draw a vector field
averaging the weighed direction of the granger causality.


Community Detection
-------------------

The communities are detected by using the walktrap algorithm. The walktrap algorithm uses the
multivariate correlated pruned network edges. Communities are tracked over time
by assigning the same color when they have more than 50% similarity.
