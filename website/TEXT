Basic Network Metrics
---------------------

The network is generated by using the multivariate correlated time-series. The
data is pruned to throw away 99% of the links. We show the data based on the
metrics in a greyscale. Black is a low value, white is a high value. The metrics
interestingly show the contours of the land.

Network Construction
--------------------
The network is generated by using the multivariate correlated time-series. The
data is pruned to throw away 99% of the links. After this the data is used for
the basic network metrics. We see some patterns and the non-locality is clear by
the many long distance links that exist.

Data sets
---------
These datasets are taken from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis project. The data shown is the raw data.


Granger Causality
-----------------

The network is generated using the granger causality of neighbouring cells less
than 5 cells away
